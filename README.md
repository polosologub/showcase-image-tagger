# showcase-image-tagger
 
 This is the AI student project tag generator for the UAL Graduate Showcase. 

 It's a Flask REST API and consists of three parts:

 1. An image tagger predicting UAL showcase tags using the OpenAI CLIP model.

 2. A text tagger generating tags based on project descriptions using the YAKE keyword extractor. 

 3. A function combining both sets of tags into one list with a maximum length (default = 20). 

### To do:
